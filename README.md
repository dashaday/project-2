I think my strenghts are definitely CSS and HTML, I like JS ut still don't feel confident enough fully working on it but I like the progrmming aspect of it. Just like Dasha I've had experince with the Adobe Photoshop, along with other adobe programs. I am also good in programming other languages and like learning about the logic and how it is implemented, and implementing it.

I believe some of my strengths include a CSS and JavaScript. I've also had a lot of experience in graphic design. I do Adobe Photoshop and calligraphy as well. I pay a lot of attention to small details and I'm also pretty good at writing and grammar.
