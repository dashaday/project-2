I think my strengths are definitely CSS and HTML, I like JS but still don't fully confident on it. Just like Dasha I've had experince with the Adobe Photoshop, along with other adobe programs. I am also good in programming other languages and like learning about the logic and how it is implemented, and implementing it.
